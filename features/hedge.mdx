## How Polystrat Works

Instead of committing everything to one side, Polystrat structures your entry across multiple outcomes, reducing dependency on a single result. On crypto markets, [Statistical Models](https://polystrat.mintlify.app/features/model) are applied to suggest the most likely outcomes and guide smarter positioning.
